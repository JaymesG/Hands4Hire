# Hands4Hire
A group project in which our team was tasked with creating a website which includes a form that could filter results based on user input. Our idea was to create a website where users could hire cartoon escorts to accompany the user to certain parties and events (e.g. Birthday Party).

*To test this project save all files to a folder and open the index.html in a program that live updates (e.g. Brackets).

When the index.html page is ran in live preview the user can see a title page with a warning ("Warning: this website is seriously toony!"). The user can either Enter the site or Exit the site. If a user clicks Exit they are taken to the wikipedia page for "Pizza". When the user clicks the Enter button they are taken to the Final.html page (or as listed in the nav bar the Home page). 

On all pages except for index.html, there is a navigation bar that displays links to the Home page, the Hire form, Profiles, and an About us page. The homepage displays blocks of text and images which are used to give the illusion of celebrity profiles who have hired cartoon characters from our website. The Profiles page (EscortProfiles.html) is a table created in html that displays photos of each potential cartoon escort and their bio. The About page (about.html) displays photos of the members of our team as well as a brief bio.

The Hire page (form.html) has several components including a textbox field with validation, a calendar field, drop down menus, color selection, check boxes, and modals. The user can click the Reset button to reset the form or click the Submit button to display the results of the user input.
